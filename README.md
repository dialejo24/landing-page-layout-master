## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm getting used to using CSS GRID and its properties. it was a good practice. I'm also using new properties for me such as
clamp, min and max. In general, what i enjoyed the most was the fact that i put in practice my responsive design skill and
i tried to use semantic HTML

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section>content</section>
```
```css
.class {
  font-size: clamp(.9rem, 1.1vw, 4rem);
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue working on responsive design and semantic HTML.
